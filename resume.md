Founded the Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network, a system for installing and
distributing mods for Kerbal Space Program. Based upon the Debian standard,
this cross-platform (Max/Linux/Windows), open source (MIT) licensed project
tracks and indexes thousands of packages, which are then made available
seamlessly to hundreds of thousands of users.

Ensured high-quality processes throughout the project and relatives. All code
was subject to continuous integration testing and required code review before
merging. Open issues were tagged by sub-system, urgency, and ease of work for
new contributors. All metadata is tracked and tagged using git, making auditing
and fault reversal straightforward. The client has had over 100 releases, all
of which have been automated using travis-ci and github.

The project has over 200 code and metadata contributors, and more than 120,000
users.

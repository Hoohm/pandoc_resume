## Education

1999
:   **Bachelor of Science**; University of Melbourne, 1999

## Notable Projects

1999-2000
:   **Network Engineer**, University of Melbourne
:   Wrote organisation-wide, internet traffic accounting software that managed traffic of 40,000+ staff and students.

2001-Present
:   **Perl Trainer and Consultant**
:   Founded and operated Perl Training Australia, which has delivered Perl and technology training to thousands of attendees across Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and Asia.

2004-Present
:   **Professional Public Speaker**
:   Links: [lanyrd speaking history](http://lanyrd.com/profile/pjf/sessions/)

:   Presented extensively on numerous technical and non-technical topics, including information security, business development, software engineering, project failure, web technologies, facebook applications, new Perl releases, cognitive biases, mental health, motivation and automation, social and global justice, asteroid mining, machine ethics, community management, and Klingon programming.

:   Keynoted at conferences worldwide, including OSCON, Linux.conf.au, /dev/world, SAGE-AU, ITx, BuzzConf, Open Source Days, ConFoo, Open Source Bridge, and others.

2007
:   **Perl's `autodie` pragma**
:   Main techologies: perl, travis-ci, git
:   Links: [github repo](https://github.com/pjf/autodie)

:   Wrote Perl's `autodie` pragma which adds exception-oriented features to Perl's built-in functions, greatly reducing the effort required for error-handling, and reducing the chance of missing error conditions in everyday programming. The pragma was rapidly adopted as part of the core language, and widely recommended as essential for all Perl programmers in books such as "Modern Perl", "Mastering Perl", and "Effective Perl Programming".

2012-Present
:   **Embedded Systems Development**
:   Main technologies: C++, platformio, arduino, travis-ci, git
:   Links: [sample costume repo](https://github.com/pjf/clockwork-masters), [room service repo](https://github.com/PopUpPlayground/room-service)

:   Responsible for numerous embedded systems in commercial projects, specialising in dynamic lighting for circus costume design, and embedded systems for escape rooms.

:   The largest project was "Room Service", including 2,300 lines of C++, continuous integration, native and embedded builds, and complex features including event queues, pathfinding, and hardware abstraction.

2013-2016
:   **Founder and Project Lead**, Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (KSP-CKAN)
:   Main technologies: C#, Perl, JSON, AWS, travis-ci, jenkins, git
:   Links: [organisation repo](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN), [main client repo](https;//github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN), [releases](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/releases)

:   Founded the Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network, a system for installing and distributing mods for Kerbal Space Program. Based upon the Debian standard, this cross-platform (Max/Linux/Windows), open source (MIT) licensed project tracks and indexes thousands of packages, which are then made available seamlessly to hundreds of thousands of users.

:   Ensured high-quality processes throughout the project and relatives. All code was subject to continuous integration testing and required code review before merging. Open issues were tagged by sub-system, urgency, and ease of work for new contributors. All metadata is tracked and tagged using git, making auditing and fault reversal straightforward. The client has had over 100 releases, all of which have been automated using travis-ci and github.

:   The project has over 200 code and metadata contributors, and more than 120,000 users.

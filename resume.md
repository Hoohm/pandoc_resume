# Education

- Bachelor of Science, University of Melbourne, 1999

# Notable Projects

## Network Engineering, University of Melbourne

- Wrote organisation-wide internet traffic accounting software

## Perl Trainer and Consultant, 2001-Present

Founded and operated Perl Training Australia, which has delivered Perl and technology training to thousands of attendees across Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and Asia.

## Public Speaker, 2004-Present

| Partial speaking history: http://lanyrd.com/profile/pjf/sessions/

Presented extensively on numerous technical and non-technical topics, including information security, business development, software engineering, project failure, web technologies, facebook applications, new Perl releases, cognitive biases, mental health, motivation and automation, social and global justice, asteroid mining, machine ethics, community management, and Klingon programming.

Keynoted at conferences worldwide, including OSCON, Linux.conf.au, /dev/world, SAGE-AU, ITx, BuzzConf, Open Source Days, ConFoo, Open Source Bridge, and others.

## Perl's `autodie` pragma, 2007

| Main techologies: perl, travis-ci, git

Wrote Perl's `autodie` pragma which adds exception-oriented features to Perl's built-in
functions, greatly reducing the effort required for error-handling, and reducing the
chance of missing error conditions in everyday programming. The pragma was rapidly
adopted as part of the core language, and widely recommended as essential for all Perl
programmers in books such as "Modern Perl", "Mastering Perl", and "Effective Perl Programming".

## Embedded systems, 2012-Present

| Main technologies: C++, platformio, arduino, travis-ci, git
| Sample costume respository: https://github.com/pjf/clockwork-masters
| Sample escape room repository: https://github.com/PopUpPlayground/room-service

Responsible for numerous embedded systems in commercial projects, specialising
in dynamic lighting for circus costume design, and embedded systems for escape rooms.

The largest project was "Room Service", including 2,300 lines of C++, continuous
integration, native and embedded builds, and complex features including event queues,
pathfinding, and hardware abstraction.

## Founder and Project Lead, Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network, 2013-2016

| Main technologies: C#, Perl, JSON, AWS, travis-ci, jenkins, git
| Organisation: https://github.com/KSP-CKAN
| Main client repo: https;//github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN

Founded the Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network, a system for installing and
distributing mods for Kerbal Space Program. Based upon the Debian standard,
this cross-platform (Max/Linux/Windows), open source (MIT) licensed project
tracks and indexes thousands of packages, which are then made available
seamlessly to hundreds of thousands of users.

Ensured high-quality processes throughout the project and relatives. All code
was subject to continuous integration testing and required code review before
merging. Open issues were tagged by sub-system, urgency, and ease of work for
new contributors. All metadata is tracked and tagged using git, making auditing
and fault reversal straightforward. The client has had over 100 releases, all
of which have been automated using travis-ci and github.

The project has over 200 code and metadata contributors, and more than 120,000
users.

## Education

1999
:   **Bachelor of Science**; University of Melbourne, 1999

## Notable Projects

1998--1999
:   **Network Engineer**, University of Melbourne
:   Main technologies: Perl, CVS, NetFlow, PostgreSQL
:   Wrote organisation-wide, internet traffic accounting software that managed traffic of 40,000+ staff and students.

1999--2001
:   **Software Architect**, SchoolsNet
:   Main technologies: Perl, Apache, Squid, MySQL
:   Developed and maintained a diverse range of server-oriented systems for use by schools and students across Australia.
:   Team leader and principal architect of the internal statistics team, measuring customer usage of products and sites.

2001--Present
:   **Perl Trainer and Consultant**
:   Main technologies: Perl, Git, Dancer, SQLite, MySQL
:   Founded and operated Perl Training Australia, which has delivered Perl and technology training to thousands of attendees across Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and Asia.
:   Consulted for organisations around the world, especially in the energy, defence, and intelligence sectors.

2004--Present
:   **Professional Public Speaker**

:   Presented extensively on numerous technical and non-technical topics, including information security, business development, software engineering, project failure, web technologies, Facebook and Android privacy, new Perl releases, cognitive biases, mental health, motivation and automation, social and global justice, asteroid mining, machine ethics, community management, and Klingon programming.

:   Keynoted at conferences worldwide, including OSCON, Linux.conf.au, /dev/world, SAGE-AU, ITx, BuzzConf, Open Source Days, ConFoo, Open Source Bridge, and others.

2007
:   **Perl's `autodie` pragma**
:   Main technologies: Perl, Travis-CI, Git
:   Links: [Github](https://github.com/pjf/autodie)

:   Wrote Perl's `autodie` pragma which adds exception-oriented features to Perl's built-in functions, greatly reducing the effort required for error-handling, and reducing the chance of missing error conditions in everyday programming. The pragma was rapidly adopted as part of the core language, and widely recommended as essential for all Perl programmers in books such as "Modern Perl", "Mastering Perl", and "Effective Perl Programming".

2012--Present
:   **Embedded Systems Development**
:   Main technologies: C++, Platformio, Arduino, Travis-CI, Git
:   Links: [Sample costume controller source](https://github.com/pjf/clockwork-masters), [Room Service source](https://github.com/PopUpPlayground/room-service)

:   Responsible for numerous embedded systems in commercial projects, specialising in dynamic lighting for circus costume design, and embedded systems for physical games.

:   The largest project was "Room Service", an escape-room style experience including 2,300 lines of C++, continuous integration, native and embedded builds, and complex features including event queues, pathfinding, and hardware abstraction.

2013--Present
:   **Project Lead and API Integrator**, Exobrain framework
:   Main technologies: Perl, 0MQ, Dancer, Docker, Twilio SMS, and many 3rd party APIs
:   Links: [Github](https://github.com/pjf/exobrain)

:   Created my own multi-platform, agent-based framework dubbed *exobrain* to further automate my life. Consumed APIs from Twitter, Facebook, RememberTheMilk, Habitica, Pushover, Beeminder, Foursquare, iDoneThis, IMAP, Twilio, and other services. Provided callback APIs for Beeminder and Tasker. Development spin-offs included the publishing of numerous Perl modules to allow others to integrate with third-party services.

2012--2015
:   **API Developer**, Information Brokers
:   Main technologies: Perl, Plack, Dancer, Starman, JSON, REST, Prove, Git
:   Links: [Information Brokers](https://www.ib.com.au/)

:   Created scalable internal APIs that bridged between the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) DataStream protocol and modern RESTful JSON ones, allowing front-end developers to use their preferred technologies rather than having to count bytes on an ISDN interface. Used mock objects to allow for both continuous unit and integration testing.

2013--Present
:   **Founder and Project Lead**, National Rick Astley hotline
:   Main technologies: Python, Flask, Zappa, Perl, Dancer, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, Twilio Voice
:   Links: [Github](https://github.com/pjf/rickastley), [PyCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2FbzZiycsM)

:   Created serverless, scalable, multi-national VoIP services to bring joy to music-lovers around the world, with interactive menus and both inbound and outbound calls. Enterprise level serverless scaling was achieved by using Zappa to deploy Python Flask applications to AWS Lambda, allowing for dynamic handling of call volumes without the need for traditional server maintenance.

2013--2016
:   **Founder and Project Lead**, Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (KSP-CKAN)
:   Main technologies: C#, Perl, JSON, JSON Schemata, Travis-CI, Jenkins, Git
:   Links: [Projects (Github)](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN), [Client source](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN)

:   Founded the Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network, a system for installing and distributing mods for Kerbal Space Program. Based upon the Debian standard, this cross-platform, open source project tracks and indexes thousands of packages, which are then made available seamlessly to hundreds of thousands of users.

:   Ensured high-quality processes throughout the project and relatives. All code was subject to continuous integration testing and required code review before merging. Open issues were tagged by sub-system, urgency, and ease of work for new contributors. All metadata is tracked and tagged using Git, making auditing and fault reversal straightforward. The client has had over 100 releases, all of which have been automated using Travis-CI and github. There have been over 200 individual contributors to the project.

2017
:   **API Developer**, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA)
:   Main technologies: Python, JavaScript, JSON, Jenkins, Travis-CI, Git, YAML, Twilio SMS, Hubot
:   Links: [Main site](http://vocabulary.unocha.org/), [Code](https://github.com/UN-OCHA/taas), [Data Exports](https://github.com/UN-OCHA/taas-data)

:   Developed UN-OCHA's *Taxonomy as a Service* (TaaS), allowing staff with no technical expertise to maintain complex taxonomies in spreadsheet form which can then be exported in JSON for consumption by other products and groups. Primarily coded in Python and executed by Jenkins, TaaS completely automates the process of converting human-readable spreadsheets into machine readable data, including auditing; machine and human review; optional, inherited, and complex fields; data transformation; and publishing. Control is via a simple chat interface using Hubot. The entire project is open source, including source code, inputs, transformation files, and outputs. As an open source project it includes numerous contributions from the public in the form of code, review, and technical advice.

:   Extended UN-OCHA's internal Hubot instance to allow operations to notify stakeholders by Twilio SMS of outages and infrastructure updates. The process of enrolling stakeholders, sending notifications, managing templates, checking for successful delivery, and reminding operations of outstanding incidents is done entirely through an the internal chat channel that's already used to monitor ongoing issues. Special attention is paid to ensure privacy of stakeholder phone numbers.

  -- but that's overkill for when I need a resume for one application. So comments it is.

2004--Present
:   **Professional Public Speaker**
:   Links: [lanyrd speaking history](http://lanyrd.com/profile/pjf/sessions/)

:   Presented extensively on numerous technical and non-technical topics, including information security, business development, software engineering, project failure, web technologies, facebook applications, new Perl releases, cognitive biases, mental health, motivation and automation, social and global justice, asteroid mining, machine ethics, community management, and Klingon programming.

:   Keynoted at conferences worldwide, including OSCON, Linux.conf.au, /dev/world, SAGE-AU, ITx, BuzzConf, Open Source Days, ConFoo, Open Source Bridge, and others.

2007
:   **Perl's `autodie` pragma**
:   Main technologies: Perl, Travis-CI, Git
:   Links: [Github repo](https://github.com/pjf/autodie)

:   Wrote Perl's `autodie` pragma which adds exception-oriented features to Perl's built-in functions, greatly reducing the effort required for error-handling, and reducing the chance of missing error conditions in everyday programming. The pragma was rapidly adopted as part of the core language, and widely recommended as essential for all Perl programmers in books such as "Modern Perl", "Mastering Perl", and "Effective Perl Programming".

2012--Present
:   **Embedded Systems Development**
:   Main technologies: C++, Platformio, Arduino, Travis-CI, Git
:   Links: [Sample costume repo](https://github.com/pjf/clockwork-masters), [Room Service repo](https://github.com/PopUpPlayground/room-service)

:   Responsible for numerous embedded systems in commercial projects, specialising in dynamic lighting for circus costume design, and embedded systems for escape rooms.

:   The largest project was "Room Service", including 2,300 lines of C++, continuous integration, native and embedded builds, and complex features including event queues, pathfinding, and hardware abstraction.

2013--Present
:   **Project Lead and API Integrator**, Exobrain framework
:   Main technologies: Perl, 0MQ, Dancer, Docker, many 3rd party APIs
:   Links: [Exobrain repo](https://github.com/pjf/exobrain)

:   Created my own multi-platform, agent-based framework dubbed *exobrain* to further automate my life. Consumed APIs from Twitter, Facebook, RememberTheMilk, Habitica, Pushover, Beeminder, Foursquare, iDoneThis, IMAP, Twilio, and other services. Provided callback APIs for Beeminder and Tasker. Development spin-offs included the publishing of numerous Perl modules to allow others to integrate with third-party services.

2012--2015
:   **API Developer**, Information Brokers
:   Main technologies: Perl, Plack, Dancer, Starman, JSON, REST, prove, Git
:   Links: [Information Brokers](https://www.ib.com.au/)

:   Created scalable internal APIs that bridged between the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) DataStream protocol and modern RESTful JSON ones, allowing front-end developers to use their preferred technologies rather than having to count bytes on an ISDN interface. Used mock objects to allow for both continuous unit and integration testing.

2013--Present
:   **Founder and Project Lead**, National Rick Astley hotline
:   Main technologies: Python, Flask, Zappa, Perl, Dancer, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, Twilio

:   Created serverless, scalable, multi-national VoIP services to bring joy to music-lovers around the world, with interactive menus and both inbound and outbound call facilities. Enterprise level serverless scaling was achieved by using Zappa to deploy Python Flask applications to AWS Lambda, allowing for dynamic handling of call volumes without the need for traditional server maintenance.

2013--2016
:   **Founder and Project Lead**, Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (KSP-CKAN)
:   Main technologies: C#, Perl, JSON, AWS, Travis-CI, Jenkins, Git
:   Links: [Projects](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN), [Client repo](https;//github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN), [Releases](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/releases)

:   Founded the Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network, a system for installing and distributing mods for Kerbal Space Program. Based upon the Debian standard, this cross-platform (Max/Linux/Windows), open source (MIT) licensed project tracks and indexes thousands of packages, which are then made available seamlessly to hundreds of thousands of users.

:   Ensured high-quality processes throughout the project and relatives. All code was subject to continuous integration testing and required code review before merging. Open issues were tagged by sub-system, urgency, and ease of work for new contributors. All metadata is tracked and tagged using Git, making auditing and fault reversal straightforward. The client has had over 100 releases, all of which have been automated using Travis-CI and github.

:   The project has over 200 code and metadata contributors, and more than 120,000 users.
